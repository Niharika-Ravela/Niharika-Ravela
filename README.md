# Hi 👋 I’m Niharika Ravela  

**Python & AI/ML Engineer • Applied Data Scientist • LLM Automation**

I build Python-based systems that combine automation, data pipelines, and AI/LLMs to make complex, document-heavy processes (invoices, grants, contracts, payroll, analytics) smarter and faster.

### 🧠 What I Work With

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **AI & ML:** LLMs (OpenAI/Azure), LangChain, NLP, scikit-learn  
- **Data & Pipelines:** Pandas, ETL workflows, data validation, document parsing (PDF/Excel)  
- **APIs & Services:** FastAPI, REST APIs, serverless/cloud functions  
- **Analytics:** Power BI, exploratory data analysis, financial & operational reporting

### 📂 Highlighted Project Areas

I’m currently organizing my repos into a few focus areas:

- **Document Intelligence & LLMs** – AI/LLM-powered extraction & validation for invoices, grants, contracts, and payroll-related documents.  
- **Python Automation & ETL** – Utilities for parsing PDFs/Excels, cleaning data, and building reusable data pipelines.  
- **Analytics & SQL** – Financial and operational analysis using SQL and BI tools.  
- **ML Fundamentals** – Classic ML models (classification/regression) in clean, reproducible pipelines.

> I prefer having a few well-structured, real-world-style projects rather than many disconnected notebooks.
